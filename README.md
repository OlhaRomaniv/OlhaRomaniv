### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Olya, and I am a beginner Frontend developer from Lviv. I am interested in web development, both in technology and design. Now I do not have my own completed projects, but I am working on the development of the shop, and in this way, I study JSON and Bootstrap, improve my JavaScript skills, and revise HTML and CSS.
My next step will be React.
